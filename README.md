# Object-detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

Okay so first of all i want to say at the time of doing this projet i learnt a lot about computer vision and convolutional neural network.
In this project i have detected dog of 5 classes using YOLO algorithm and convolutional neural network with tensorflow as backend.
